# EyeRest
Give your eyes a rest from the bright screen(s) and take a break.

Using a hotkey, you're able to quickly 'paint' your monitor black and give your eyes a break, 
without turning off your monitors or adjusting the brightness. When you're ready to get back to work,
just press your key combination again and you're off.
